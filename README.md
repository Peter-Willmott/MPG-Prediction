## MPG Prediction App

This simple application can be used to predict the MPG of a car.
The app asks you to select values for the:

  - Horsepower (HP)
  - Number of Cylinders (Cyl)
  - Weight (wt)
  
and from these variables and their given values predicts the MPG of the car.
THe app uses the Motor Trend Car Road Tests dataset (mtcars)
The data was extracted from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine, and comprises fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance for 32 automobiles (1973â€“74 models).

### Layout

The layout of the app has the inputs on the left panel, ranked Horsepower, Number of cylinders and weight (tons). Horsepower and Weight are both represented with a slider ranging from 60-330 and 1.6-5.4 respectivly. Number of cylinders is represented with radio buttons indicating 4,6 or 8 cylinders.
The right panel has the outputs. The first 3 outputs indicate the Horsepower, number of cylinders and Weight that was selected in the input. The final output block gives the predicted MPG value. 

It is that simple,
